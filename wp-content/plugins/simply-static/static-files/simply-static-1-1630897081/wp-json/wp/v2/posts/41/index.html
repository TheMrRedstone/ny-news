The company he co-founded to build Oculus was sold to Facebook in March 2014 for $2 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Luckey stayed on to work with Facebook. But three years later, he left amid backlash after it was reported that he had donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump group that created anti-Hillary Clinton memes. He later said in a Facebook post that he had donated to the group because he thought they had &#8220;fresh ideas.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p> <!----><\/div>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.foxnews.com\/~r\/foxnews\/politics\/~3\/rDucjGhAih0\/high-tech-virtual-wall-is-the-latest-defense-at-the-us-mexico-border\">Source link <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The feds have turned to cutting-edge cameras developed by a virtual reality wunderkind to help them monitor the southern border<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":42,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8,7,3,4,2,6,9,5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/41"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=41"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/41\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/42"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=41"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=41"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=41"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
