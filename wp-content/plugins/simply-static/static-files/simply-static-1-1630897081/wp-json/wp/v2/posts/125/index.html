We saw intense weather events in 2017. Last year was a record number of hurricanes and a record wildfire season. The U.N. had just put out their climate report and they said that this is the climate crisis that we\u2019re facing and it\u2019s only going to continue to get worse.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wallace pressed Criswell on how climate change can be responsible for all weather extremes, including record heat and record cold, as well as drought and flooding, which seems to be &#8220;contradictory.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You know, I don\u2019t know how climate impacts it specifically,&#8221; Criswell responded. &#8220;What I do know is that we are seeing more frequent storms, more intense storms.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/foxnews.onelink.me\/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Criswell praised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/category\/person\/joe-biden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President Biden<\/a> for authorizing $5 billion in &#8220;resilience funding&#8221; last month\u00a0for states and local communities to increase preparedness in advance of natural disasters. She also touted the bipartisan $1T infrastructure plan,\u00a0the first phase of the president&#8217;s infrastructure plan, that she said would help rebuild infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather conditions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My understanding is there are parts of that plan that are going to also contribute and add additional funding to the mitigation efforts,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But the other part of that plan is helping to strengthen our infrastructure in general. We have a very old infrastructure across this country and we need to work on rebuilding that, building it back stronger so it can be more resilient to future threats.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p> <!----><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday that climate change is the &#8220;crisis of our generation&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":126,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8,7,3,4,2,6,9,5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/125"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=125"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/125\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/126"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=125"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=125"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=125"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
