Those living in villages were randomly assigned a number of interventions to promote the use of masks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Researchers found that those living in the villages with such interventions were around 11% less likely to develop COVID-19 than those who did not. The effectiveness increased to nearly 35% for people over 60 years old, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/med.stanford.edu\/news\/all-news\/2021\/09\/surgical-masks-covid-19.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stanford Medicine<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/pregnant-women-unvaccinated-covid-19\"><strong>ABOUT 3 IN 4 PREGNANT WOMEN IN US UNVACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our study is the first randomized controlled trial exploring whether facial masking prevents COVID-19 transmission at the community level,&#8221; said Ashley Styczynski, one of the lead authors and an infectious disease fellow at Stanford. &#8220;It\u2019s notable that even though fewer than 50% of the people in the intervention villages wore masks in public places, we still saw a significant risk reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 in these communities, particularly in elderly, more vulnerable people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The study also looked at the effect of using cloth instead of surgical masks: Cloth masks did reduce the overall likelihood of experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness, but it was not as effective as using a surgical mask.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/two-vaccines-long-haul-covid-study\"><strong>GETTING TWO VACCINES CHOPS \u2018LONG-HAUL\u2019 COVID RISK IN HALF: STUDY<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We saw an opportunity to better understand the effect of masks, which can be a very important way for people in low-resource areas to protect themselves while they wait for vaccines,&#8221; said Laura Kwong, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford and assistant professor at the University of California-Berkeley. &#8220;So we collaborated with behavioral scientists, economists, public health experts and religious figures to design ways to promote mask use at a community level.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The study paired the 600 villages, assigning one with mask distribution and some promotion of policy, which involved notable Bangladeshi figures \u2013 such as the prime minister, a star cricket player and an imam \u2013 wearing masks and explaining why wearing masks was important. Additionally, individuals not wearing masks nor social distancing were regularly reminded to do so.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In villages without these interventions, around 13% of people wore masks properly compared to 42% in villages with the guidance. Social distancing only slightly improved with 24.1% in the control villages versus 29.2% in the intervention villages.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP<\/u><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is statistically significant and, we believe, probably a low estimate of the effectiveness of surgical masks in community settings,&#8221; Styczynski said.<\/p>\n<p> <!----><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new study that examined the effects of mask-wearing on the spread of COVID-19 found that even partial adoption helps<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":103,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8,7,3,4,2,6,9,5],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/102"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=102"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/102\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/103"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=102"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=102"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/nynews\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=102"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
