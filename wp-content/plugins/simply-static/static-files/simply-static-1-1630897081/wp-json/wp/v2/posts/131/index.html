That created some unique and sometimes challenging circumstances, but we protected each other and took care of each other. That commonality puts us in a very small club.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Williams added that he\u2019s especially close to Christopher Knight who played Peter Brady in the series.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/entertainment\/ann-jillian-its-a-living-cancer-battle-former-child-star\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>FORMER CHILD STAR ANN JILLIAN ON BECOMING AN \u201880S SEX SYMBOL, FIGHTING CANCER AT 35: \u2018I JUMPED RIGHT IN\u2019<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<div source=\"Getty Images\" class=\"image-ct inline\">\n<div class=\"m\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/1470\/828\/Getty_BradyBunch.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><source media=\"(min-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/1862\/1048\/Getty_BradyBunch.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/640\/320\/Getty_BradyBunch.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\" alt=\"Pictured, top row: Christopher Knight (Peter), Barry Williams (Greg), Ann B.

It\u2019s a show that has been with me now for over 50 years, and I consider the cast members a second family. I know that there is interest and curiosity around the show, and I\u2019m happy to oblige.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And despite growing up in the public eye, Williams said he\u2019s always had a deep appreciation for performing, as well as for the opportunities that Hollywood provided along the way.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<div source=\"Getty Images\" class=\"image-ct inline\">\n<div class=\"m\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/1470\/828\/Getty_BarryWilliams_GregBrady.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><source media=\"(min-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/1862\/1048\/Getty_BarryWilliams_GregBrady.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/640\/320\/Getty_BarryWilliams_GregBrady.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\" alt=\"Barry Williams starred as Greg Brady in the beloved TV series.\"\/><\/source><\/source><\/picture><\/div>\n<div class=\"caption\">\n<p>\n      Barry Williams starred as Greg Brady in the beloved TV series.<br \/>\n      <span class=\"copyright\">(Photo by CBS via Getty Images)<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, I was committed to a lifetime of show business long before \u2018The Brady Bunch,\u2019&#8221; said Williams. &#8220;In fact, I don\u2019t think any of us really held up high hopes that it would have this kind of endurance. Even by television standards, it\u2019s a pretty unique series. It\u2019s been a sitcom, a cartoon show, a variety hour, a Christmas special, a movie twice (we did my book [\u2018Growing Up Brady\u2019] as a TV movie) and \u2018A Very Brady Renovation.\u2019 There have been so many things around it, more than pretty much any television series I can think of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No, I\u2019m grateful,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I\u2019ve been able to have a successful career in virtually every aspect of show business \u2014 television, movies, cartoon shows, and as a musician, singer and recording artist. I have worked in Las Vegas. I\u2019ve been a DJ for SiriusXM. I have produced television. I have written a best-selling book. I think being able to have that kind of diversity has been just marvelous. There\u2019s been no boredom.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And Williams has pursued his other passions along the way. According to the outlet, the star became a private pilot at one point and flew a small single-engine aircraft &#8220;around the country.&#8221; Maui, he said, is his favorite island to visit.<\/p>\n<p>When asked if his two children have been compelled to pursue a similar career path, Williams said &#8220;they have not.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/apps-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<div source=\"Getty Images\" class=\"image-ct inline\">\n<div class=\"m\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/1470\/828\/Getty_BarryWilliams.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><source media=\"(min-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/1862\/1048\/Getty_BarryWilliams.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/640\/320\/Getty_BarryWilliams.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\" alt=\"Barry Williams is proud of his time as a child star in Hollywood.\"\/><\/source><\/source><\/picture><\/div>\n<div class=\"caption\">\n<p>\n      Barry Williams is proud of his time as a child star in Hollywood.<br \/>\n      <span class=\"copyright\">(Photo by Gabe Ginsberg\/FilmMagic\/Getty Images)<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&#8220;My son is a musician, but also a full-time student, and hasn\u2019t made any [comments] about going into that as a profession,&#8221; he shared. &#8220;My little girl is a natural.
