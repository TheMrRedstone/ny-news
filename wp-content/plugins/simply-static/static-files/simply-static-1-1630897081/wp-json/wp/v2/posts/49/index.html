Seattle improved to 14-4 in extra inning games, continuing a trend of playing its best in big moments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Heck of an effort by our guys,&#8221; Mariners manager Scott Servais said. &#8220;This team is so much fun.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Seattle&#8217;s J.P Crawford started the 11th on second base and then Mitch Haniger and Ty France drew back-to-back walks off Taylor Clarke (1-3), who threw just three strikes in 13 pitches. Seager ripped his bases-loaded double down the right-field line, followed by RBI singles from Abraham Toro and Tom Murphy.<\/p>\n<p>Jake Bauers added a two-run double and Haniger had an RBI single to complete the seven-run outburst. The Mariners sent 11 batters to the plate in the 11th. Yohan Ramirez (1-2) pitched a scoreless 10th for his first MLB win, capping a stellar effort from Seattle&#8217;s bullpen.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I tried to stay calm and not allow the game to speed up,&#8221; Ramirez said. &#8220;Then I just attacked hitters and control what I can control.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Seager&#8217;s crucial double capped a stellar couple days for the veteran third baseman. He had two 3-run homers in Saturday&#8217;s win.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He\u2019s seeing the ball really good right now,&#8221; Servais said.<\/p>\n<p>The Diamondbacks took a 3-2 lead in the sixth when Pavin Smith brought home Josh Rojas with an RBI double. David Peralta followed with a two-run homer into the left-center seats.<\/p>\n<p>The Mariners tied the game at 3-all in the seventh when Toro led off with a double and eventually scored on a double play.<\/p>\n<p>Seattle starter Chris Flexen cruised through the first five innings \u2014 giving up just one hit on a bunt single \u2014 before the D-backs scored three in the sixth. Flexen threw six innings, giving up three runs. The right-hander four hits, two walks and struck out four.<\/p>\n<p>D-backs starter Tyler Gilbert gave up three runs over seven innings. The rookie left-hander allowed four hits, two walks and struck out three.<\/p>\n<p>It was the same frustrating story for the Diamondbacks, who have generally been competitive since the All-Star break but haven&#8217;t been able to pull out many wins. They&#8217;re now 45-93, which is the worst record in the National League.<\/p>\n<p>They might eclipse their worst season in franchise history, when they had 111 losses in 2004.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We were a hit or two away from winning two out of three games,&#8221; D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. &#8220;Instead, we lost two extra-inning games.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Mariners jumped ahead 2-0 in the fourth inning when Haniger walked and France singled to start the inning. Seager then reached to load the bases on a defensive mental blunder by D-backs first baseman Pavin Smith, who threw home to stop Haniger, who was faking a charge down the baseline and then retreated to third.<\/p>\n<p>Toro then brought home Haniger on a fielder&#8217;s choice and Tom Murphy made it 2-0 on his sacrifice fly that scored France.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/foxnews.onelink.me\/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP<\/u><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>FUN WITH NUMBERS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Peralta&#8217;s homer was his 97th with Arizona, which is tied with catcher Miguel Montero for eighth all-time in D-backs history.
