the relative explained. &#8220;So she went back to her house, about ten hours north of Kabul.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit more remote, but they&#8217;re still doing door-to-door checks,&#8221;

the relative said, referring to the Taliban. &#8220;If you had younger boys they were recruiting them and taking them and not allowing them to cross.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/califorina-students-rescued-afghanistan-thousands-more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>AFTER CALIFORNIA STUDENTS RESCUED FROM AFGHANISTAN, OFFICIALS SAY THERE COULD &#8216;EASILY&#8217;
