However, colorectal cancer screenings can help find the growths so they can be removed before progressing to cancer.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The most effective way to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer is to get screened for colorectal cancer routinely, beginning at age 45,&#8221; per the health agency\u2019s webpage, which notes millions of Americans are missing recommended screenings and the chance to find and treat the cancer early. By 2018, 68.8% of U.S. adults aged 50-75 were up-to-date on colorectal cancer screening, up from 67.4% in 2016.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/colorectal-cancer-delayed-screenings-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>WOMAN SHOCKED BY COLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS AFTER SCREENINGS WERE DELAYED DURING PANDEMIC<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Colon and rectum cancers occurred at a rate of 36.5 per 100,000 in 2018, with over 140,000 new reported cancer cases and 52,163 related deaths that year, per the latest available figures.
