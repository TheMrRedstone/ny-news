They have the highest positivity rates in America. We have one of the lowest case rates in America.

But Newsom argued that such moves would set California back in its battle to combat the coronavirus and emphasized that &#8220;there is no more consequential decision to the health and safety of the people, the state of California, than voting \u2018no\u2019 on this Republican recall.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A new Newsom ad running on California airwaves\u00a0warns that &#8220;what\u2019s at stake in the September 14 recall? It\u2019s a matter of life and death.&#8221; And it charges that Elder &#8220;peddled deadly conspiracy theories and would eliminate vaccine mandates on day one.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Elder, in his Fox News interview, insisted that &#8220;I&#8217;m not anti-vax, despite what his ads say. I&#8217;ve been vaccinated because I&#8217;m in a high-risk category and I urge people who are in categories that are high-risk to be vaccinated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe the science does compel children to be vaccinated. They&#8217;re not likely to contract the coronavirus. They&#8217;re not likely to get really sick.
