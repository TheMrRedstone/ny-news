One in every 134 people in Tennessee tested positive in the past week, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, 42.1% of the population is now fully vaccinated against the virus.<\/p>\n<p>Gov. Bill Lee told reporters earlier this week that the vaccine was the key tool to overcoming the outbreak. But he said he had &#8220;no plans&#8221; to change the state\u2019s current pandemic mitigation strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Parents of disabled students have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down Iowa\u2019s law banning schools from requiring masks, arguing it endangers their health and denies equal access to education.<\/p>\n<p>The lawsuit is backed by the American Civil Liberties Union and disability rights organizations. Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are climbing in Iowa to their highest levels since last winter.<\/p>\n<p>Iowa is averaging about 1,200 confirmed cases per day in the last week, and roughly a quarter of those are among ages 17 and under. About 5% of Iowa patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infections on Wednesday were age 17 or below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/category\/us\/us-regions\/midwest\/iowa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gov. Kim Reynolds <\/a>defended the law at a news conference, saying it lets parents choose whether their students should wear masks.

Sununu is vaccinated, receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on April 10.<\/p>\n<p>He took a trip to Kentucky on Monday to see how officials in that state are handling a surge in cases.<\/p>\n<p>A nurse staffing crisis is forcing many U.S. hospitals to pay top dollar to get reinforcements to handle the crush of COVID-19 patients this summer.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/parent-calls-cops-maskless-students-new-york-school\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>PARENT CALLS COPS AFTER MASKLESS STUDENTS PULLED FROM CLASS AT NEW YORK SCHOOL<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The problem, health leaders say, is twofold: Nurses are quitting or retiring, exhausted or demoralized by the crisis. Many are leaving for lucrative temporary jobs with traveling-nurse agencies that can pay $5,000 or more a week.<\/p>\n<p>In Texas, more than 6,000 travel nurses have flooded the state to help through a state-supported program. But the same time 19 travel nurses started work at a hospital in the northern part of the state, 20 other nurses there gave notice they\u2019d be leaving for a traveling contract, said Carrie Kroll, a vice president at the Texas Hospital Association.<\/p>\n<p>President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to start delivery of booster shots by Sept. 20 for most Americans who received COVID-19 vaccines is facing complications that could delay the availability for those who received the Moderna vaccine, administration officials said Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Biden announced last month that his administration was preparing to administer boosters to provide more enduring protection against the coronavirus, pending approvals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. He recommended boosters eight months after the second shot.<\/p>\n<p>However, those agencies are awaiting critical data before signing off on the third doses, with Moderna\u2019s vaccine increasingly seen as unlikely to make the Sept. 20 date.<\/p>\n<p>According to one official, Moderna produced inadequate data for the FDA and CDC to approve the third dose of its vaccine. The FDA has requested additional data that is likely to delay those boosters into October. Pfizer is further along in the review process, with an FDA panel review on boosters on Sept. 17.<\/p>\n<p>Wisconsin\u2019s $100 reward program for those receiving the COVID-19 vaccine will be extended two weeks until Sept. 19.<\/p>\n<p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers says extending the incentive will give an opportunity for more people to get vaccinated. The program began Aug. 20 and was originally scheduled to end Monday.<\/p>\n<p>Between Aug. 20 and Sept. 1, more than 65,000 people received their first dose. Evers launched the program amid a spike in cases across the state caused by the more infectious delta variant. The level of new cases and hospitalizations are at a level not seen since January.<\/p>\n<p>On Aug. 22, the day before Evers announced the program, the seven-day average of vaccinations in Wisconsin was 8,360. That grew to 9,712 as of Wednesday. More than 3 million people are fully vaccinated in Wisconsin, about 52% of the total population. Among adults age 18 and over, more than 62% are fully vaccinated.<\/p>\n<div source=\"AP Newsroom\" class=\"image-ct inline\">\n<div class=\"m\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1470\/828\/AP21244285265371.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><source media=\"(min-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1862\/1048\/AP21244285265371.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/640\/320\/AP21244285265371.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\" alt=\"Kristen Connelly, R.N. of the Surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at St. Luke's Boise Medical Center in Boise, Idaho holds back tears as she talks about the pressure of dealing with the influx of patients to the hospital because of COVID-19 on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021.

Its surge has dashed widespread hopes that this year\u2019s observances, unlike those of 2020, could once again fill synagogues with congregants worshipping side by side. One rabbi in Florida has decided to hold only virtual services for the holy days.<\/p>\n<p>Other synagogues are offering a mix of in-person and virtual offerings. Temple Beth El, in Augusta, Maine, will require masks inside the synagogue. Workers also erected a big tent in the yard for an outdoor service Sept. 7.<\/p>\n<p>Intensive care beds are full of unvaccinated coronavirus patients at a hospital in Boise, Idaho, and doctors are bracing for the need to conserve scarce resources for the patients most likely to survive.<\/p>\n<p>At St. Luke\u2019s Boise Medical Center, the view in every direction is heartbreaking. In one room, a pregnant woman in her second trimester relies on an artificial breathing machine.

The government says it\u2019s confident it will meet its target of having 80% of the eligible population vaccinated by the end of September.<\/p>\n<p>Health Minister Roberto Speranza says the government &#8220;wants this number to grow even more&#8221; and is weighing whether to extend the Green Pass requirements to other situations. The pass indicates a person has at least one vaccine dose, recovered from COVID-19 in the last six months or tested negative for the illness in the last 48 hours.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s needed to dine indoors, access gyms, attend concerts or travel on domestic flights or train, ferry or bus between Italy\u2019s regions.
