City legal counsel is currently evaluating the legal aspects of this proposed resolution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Texas state law, which took effect last Wednesday, allows anyone anywhere to sue anyone connected to an abortion in which cardiac activity was detected in the embryo \u2014 as early as six weeks into a pregnancy before most women even realize they are pregnant.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/portland-police-gun-violence-unit-struggles-find-officers-homicide-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>PORTLAND POLICE&#8217;S NEWLY RESURRECTED GUN VIOLENCE TEAM CAN&#8217;T FIND OFFICERS TO FILL UNIT: REPORT\u00a0<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>By Friday, state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted Planned Parenthood a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/texas-judge-shields-states-clinics-from-anti-abortion-groups-lawsuits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">temporary restraining order<\/a> under the new law, shielding its clinics from whistleblower lawsuits by the nonprofit group Texas Right to Life, its legislative director and 100 unidentified individuals.<\/p>\n<p>In Portland, Wheeler affirmed, &#8220;This law does not demonstrate concern for the health, safety, and well-being of those who may become pregnant. This law does not recognize or show respect for the human rights of those who may become pregnant. This law rewards private individuals for exercising surveillance and control over others\u2019 bodies. It violates the separation of church and state. And, it will force people to carry pregnancies against their will.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We stand with Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Stephen Breyer, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who fought to block this attack on the reproductive rights, freedom, and autonomy of people across the country,&#8221; the mayor\u2019s statement continued. &#8220;We urge other leaders and elected bodies around the nation to join us in condemning the actions of the Texas state government. Portland City Council stands with the people who may one day face difficult decisions about pregnancy, and we respect their right to make the best decision for themselves.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Portland has grown a reputation for its liberalism, and as the Oregon\u2019s largest city often seen clashes between far-left and far-right groups, other violent crime has been on the rise. In August, Portland police was struggling to find officers willing to serve on its newly resurrected gun violence unit, which was dismantled over a year ago at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.<\/p>\n<p>Homicides have surged since the unit was disbanded last summer after the Portland City Council voted last summer to slash the police bureau\u2019s budget by $15 million. Amid the uptick in gun violence, Wheeler, a Democrat, proposed a new unit in March renamed the &#8220;Focused Initiative Team.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This comes a year after Wheeler condemned former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to intervene in Portland as violent, anti-police demonstrations targeting federal property persisted last summer in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death.
