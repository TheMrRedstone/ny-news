<p class="speakable">Gregg Leakes, husband of &#8220;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&#8221; star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news"><u>NeNe Leakes</u></a><u>,</u> has died from colon cancer, Fox News confirmed Wednesday. He was 66 years old. But who is most at risk and how can people lower the risk of the deadly cancer?</p>
<p class="speakable">Gregg was <a href="https://pagesix.com/2018/11/05/nene-leakes-reveals-husband-gregg-has-stage-3-colon-cancer/"><u>diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer</u></a> in 2018, but it <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/05/13/nene-leakes-gives-update-on-husband-greggs-cancer/"><u>went into remission</u></a> after treatment. In June, however, NeNe confirmed that <a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/06/29/nene-leakes-reveals-husband-greggs-cancer-has-returned/"><u>his cancer had returned.</u></a></p>

<p>Nearly all colorectal cancers start as abnormal growths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which notes the growths, or &#8220;precancerous polyps&#8221; may not result in symptoms for years. However, colorectal cancer screenings can help find the growths so they can be removed before progressing to cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most effective way to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer is to get screened for colorectal cancer routinely, beginning at age 45,&#8221; per the health agency’s webpage, which notes millions of Americans are missing recommended screenings and the chance to find and treat the cancer early. By 2018, 68.8% of U.S. adults aged 50-75 were up-to-date on colorectal cancer screening, up from 67.4% in 2016.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/colorectal-cancer-delayed-screenings-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WOMAN SHOCKED BY COLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSIS AFTER SCREENINGS WERE DELAYED DURING PANDEMIC</strong></a></p>
<p>Colon and rectum cancers occurred at a rate of 36.5 per 100,000 in 2018, with over 140,000 new reported cancer cases and 52,163 related deaths that year, per the latest available figures. Annual rates of new colorectal cancers and cancer-related deaths in the U.S. have been gradually declining since 1999, though the number of new annual cases has increased on several occasions.</p>

</div>
<p>Aside from screenings, lifestyle changes may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, like boosting exercise, limiting alcohol intake and avoiding tobacco. Researchers are working to determine whether aspirin use and diet changes can lower the risk of colorectal cancer too, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>Colon cancer risk increases with age, but other risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease, personal or family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps and a genetic syndrome (<a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-adenomatous-polyposis"><u>familial adenomatous polyposis</u></a> or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/disease/colorectal_cancer/lynch.htm"><u>hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome)</u></a>, the agency adds.</p>
<p>Symptoms may include change in bowel habits, bloody stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramps and inexplicable weight loss, among others. The CDC advises consulting a doctor upon experiencing these symptoms, which could result from something else aside from cancer.</p>

<p class="speakable">A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/sharks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shark</a> born at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Italy&#8217;s</a> Acquario Cala Gonone could be the first case of asexual reproduction in its <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science/biology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">species</a>.</p>
<p class="speakable">The Sardinia-based facility says its female smooth-hound shark &#8220;Ispera&#8221; was born in a tank with only female sharks. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-shark-sightings-flag-warnings-beaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NEW YORK SHARK SIGHTING PROMPT NEW FLAG WARNINGS AT BEACHES</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;#Ispera was born, a female palombo shark, probably from parthenogenesis, that is without the male&#8217;s intervention,&#8221; the aquarium <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AcquarioCalaGonone/posts/4396580637047377" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on Facebook</a>, according to a Google translation of the post. &#8220;The mother lives in the large pelagic tub with another female specimen. If confirmed by DNA analysis, it would be the world&#8217;s first documented parthenogenesis documented by Mustelus Mustelus. Ispera, the name chosen for the little one, in Sardinian means hope and a birth in the [<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19</a>] era it certainly is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acquario Cala Gonone said in the comments section that it was still waiting on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/natural-science/genetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNA</a> testing to confirm this claim. </p>
<p>The organization cites parthenogenesis, a process in which the development of a female gamete occurs without fertilization by sperm, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/parthenogenesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/parthenogenesis-how-animals-have-virgin-births" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Geographic explained</a> that the forms of parthenogenesis include automixis and apomixis. </p>
<p>In automixis, small cells called polar bodies – also produced through meiosis with eggs – can merge with an egg to produce offspring and create offspring that are similar to the mother but not exact clones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/how-to-reduce-the-risk-of-a-shark-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A SHARK ATTACK</u></strong></a></p>
<p>In apomixis, reproductive cells replicate using mitosis, forming genetically identical offspring.</p>
<p>Parthenogenesis, or &#8220;virgin births,&#8221; have previously been observed in tens of species including plants, insects, reptiles, birds, fish and other sharks as well. </p>
<p>The magazine noted the case of a zebra shark named Leonie that shocked caretakers at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australia’s</a> Reef HQ Aquarium when she gave birth in 2016.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the most common mechanisms that allow this type of reproduction is one where the egg is fertilized by another still immature egg cell, which actually acts almost like a sperm. Parthenogenesis can be optional in species that normally reproduce sexually, as in some reptiles, fish and even birds, and could be favored in very low-density populations, where females have little chance of meeting their partner,&#8221; Acquario Cala Gonone wrote. </p>
<p>&#8220;It would therefore be a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific discovery</a> of considerable interest, since it could pave the way for research aimed at verifying how parthenogenesis is a process that the palombes use even in nature,&#8221; it said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep you posted!&#8221;</p>
<p>While smooth-hound Mustelus Mustelus sharks of the Triakidae family prefer the temperate east Atlantic – including the U.K., Mediterranean, Morocco, Canaries, the Azores and Madeira, <a href="https://www.sharks.org/smoothhound-mustelus-mustelus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Shark Research Institute shows,</a> and they have also been found from Angola to South Africa and the Indian Ocean coastline.</p>

<p>The gray and gray-brown shark is occasionally covered in dark spots and appears slender with a short head and snout and large close-set eyes.</p>
<p>At birth, the shark is just 1.3 feet in length and male sharks measure up to at least 5.6 feet, with females reaching at least 5.4 feet.</p>

</p>
<div>
<p class="speakable">Deanne Criswell, administrator of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/fema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Emergency Management Agency,</a> said Sunday that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> is the &#8220;crisis of our generation&#8221; after Hurricane Ida tore through the country and left at least <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-ida-death-toll-at-least-66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66 people</a> dead nationwide.</p>
<p class="speakable">Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/fox-news-sunday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Fox News Sunday&#8221;</a> with Chris Wallace, Criswell said the frequency and intensity of recent weather events point to the &#8220;impacts of climate change&#8221; and that the federal government needs to start investing in reducing the impacts of those events.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-ida-death-toll-at-least-66" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>HURRICANE IDA DEATH TOLL RISES TO AT LEAST 66 NATIONWIDE AS RECOVERY EFFORTS CONTINUE</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;This storm in particular, it intensified so rapidly … in the Gulf, that emergency managers and emergency responders had an even shorter time to warn the public and help get them out of harm’s way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This storm and some of the other weather events that we’ve seen, they’re just intensifying very rapidly and dropping a large amount of rain and tornadoes.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;This is the crisis of our generation, these impacts we’re seeing from climate change, and we have to act now to try to protect against the future risks we’re going to face,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I think this is going to be our new normal. We saw intense weather events in 2017. Last year was a record number of hurricanes and a record wildfire season. The U.N. had just put out their climate report and they said that this is the climate crisis that we’re facing and it’s only going to continue to get worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallace pressed Criswell on how climate change can be responsible for all weather extremes, including record heat and record cold, as well as drought and flooding, which seems to be &#8220;contradictory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I don’t know how climate impacts it specifically,&#8221; Criswell responded. &#8220;What I do know is that we are seeing more frequent storms, more intense storms.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>
<p>Criswell praised <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden</a> for authorizing $5 billion in &#8220;resilience funding&#8221; last month for states and local communities to increase preparedness in advance of natural disasters. She also touted the bipartisan $1T infrastructure plan, the first phase of the president&#8217;s infrastructure plan, that she said would help rebuild infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;My understanding is there are parts of that plan that are going to also contribute and add additional funding to the mitigation efforts,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But the other part of that plan is helping to strengthen our infrastructure in general. We have a very old infrastructure across this country and we need to work on rebuilding that, building it back stronger so it can be more resilient to future threats.&#8221;</p>

<p class="speakable">The U.S. war in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/afghanistan/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afghanistan</a> basically ended this past week. After 20 years, America’s longest war came  to a close with the last <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S.</a> troops exiting Kabul.</p>
<p class="speakable">But <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. service members</a> around the world were still very busy, evacuating Americans, Afghans and others out of the clutches of the new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taliban</a> rulers. Including those stationed at the massive American Ramstein Airbase in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany,</a> a key transit hub for those leaving Afghanistan and going on to the U.S. </p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been pretty much nonstop,&#8221; Captain James Dimmick, who’s managing air operations at the base, told Fox News. &#8220;We’ve been 24 hours every day of the week so far. … Just getting as many people in and out as we possibly can.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/last-u-s-troops-have-departed-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>LAST US TROOPS HAVE DEPARTED AFGHANISTAN</strong></a></p>
<p>Huge C-17 transport planes flew the Afghans directly in from Kabul or via other bases in places like Qatar.  Then after the refugees are checked out and vetted they board specially-chartered commercial planes to fly on to the States. </p>
<p>The commander of Ramstein, Brig. General Joshua Olson, told us it’s all about &#8220;… humanity and providing hope.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sometimes those flying in are not in great shape. Like the 20 injured Marines and other service members medevaced there following the deadly ISIS terror attack at Kabul’s airport. They were treated at the nearby American military hospital, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. Some, too, were near death. All were treated until well enough to be flown back to Walter Reed Medical Center in the States. </p>
<p>&#8220;They can go out and do what they need to do … what their country is asking them to do&#8221; Col. Jodelle Schroeder, head of nursing at the hospital, told Fox News, &#8220;because we’ve got their back.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/army-unit-posts-photo-of-last-us-soldier-to-leave-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ARMY UNIT POSTS PHOTO OF LAST US SOLDIER TO LEAVE AFGHANISTAN</strong></a></p>
<p>As for the Afghans themselves, they had mixed feelings when we spoke with them but were grateful to be out of the chaos of the country.   </p>
<p>&#8220;I think the country is going the wrong way,&#8221; one told Fox News. &#8220;It will not be the same as it was.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t think the future will be very good,&#8221; another said. </p>
<p>They have no illusions about the new Taliban rulers after having seen what the extreme Islamists did 20 years ago when they last ran the country. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/taliban-spokesperson-speaks-to-fox-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TALIBAN SPOKESPERSON WARNS US NOT TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR CULTURE, TREATMENT OF WOMEN</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;We have history with the Taliban,&#8221; an Afghan asserted. &#8220;We saw them once before … enemies never change.&#8221; </p>
<p>And many were worried about the thousands left behind, including family members, all potentially in harm’s way following the rapid U.S. withdrawal and evacuation.</p>

<p class="quote-text">&#8220;We have history with the Taliban,&#8221; an Afghan asserted. &#8220;We saw them once before … enemies never change.&#8221; </p>
<p> <!----></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;My brother, my family, all the people who worked for the U.S. military, they are still there,&#8221; yet another Afghan explained. &#8220;They’re stranded.&#8221; </p>
<p>We asked commanding General Olson if he had wanted more time. &#8220;We always want more time,&#8221; he told us, &#8220;more time … and more sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>As for this period representing the end of America’s war in Afghanistan, most of the service members there were also too busy to spend much time reflecting on it. But several told us that the nearly 20 years of fighting there basically tracked their whole career in the military. There is a personal stake. </p>
<p>&#8220;Was it all worth it?&#8221; I asked Germany-posted Lt. Col Elizabeth Dwyer.  &#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; she replied. </p>
<p>&#8220;Saving lives?&#8221; I suggested.  </p>

<p>&#8220;That’s what we do,&#8221; she stated emphatically. </p>
<p>They do that … and a lot more. Political debate aside, on vivid and emotional display to us at the crucial U.S. military hub in Germany in the past week, among Americans and Afghans: dedication, relief, concern … and, yes, humanity.   </p>

<p class="speakable">The U.S. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/navy">Navy</a> on Sunday identified the five sailors now presumed dead after a more than 72-hour search and rescue mission was called off following their helicopter crash off the coast of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/san-diego" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Diego</a>. </p>
<p class="speakable">The five sailors, all assigned to the Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 8, were identified as Lt. Bradley A. Foster, 29, a pilot from Oakhurst, California; Lt. Paul R. Fridley, 28, a pilot from Annandale, Virginia; Naval Air Crewman (Helicopter) 2nd Class James P. Buriak, 31, from Salem, Virginia; Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Sarah F. Burns, 31, from Severna Park, Maryland; and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Bailey J. Tucker, 21, from St. Louis, Missouri. Their bodies all remain missing. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/navy-helicopter-crash-san-diego-sailors-missing-uss-abraham-lincoln" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>NAVY HELICOPTER CRASH OFF SAN DIEGO: 5 SAILORS MISSING, 5 MORE INJURED ON USS LINCOLN </strong></a></p>
<p>On Saturday, the U.S Navy declared all five deceased, shifting from search and rescue efforts to recovery operations after more than 72 hours of coordinated rescue efforts encompassing 34 search and rescue flights, over 170 hours of flight time, with five search helicopters and constant surface vessel search. </p>
<p>The sailors were riding in a MH-60S helicopter &#8220;conducting routine flight operations&#8221; from USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) when the aircraft crashed into the sea approximately 60 nautical miles off the coast of San Diego at 4:30 p.m. PST, Aug. 31, the U.S. Navy 3rd Fleet said. </p>
<p>A sixth sailor aboard the helicopter at the time of the crash was rescued later that same day and has since been transported ashore in stable condition. In addition to the five missing from the helicopter, Navy officials disclosed that another five were injured on the ship when the aircraft operating on the deck crashed into the sea. </p>

<p>Units involved in search and rescue efforts included assets from Coast Guard District 11, Abraham Lincoln, USS Cincinnati (LCS 20), and helicopter squadrons from the U.S. Pacific Fleet Helicopter Sea Combat Wing and Helicopter Maritime Strike Wing. An investigation into the incident is underway. </p>

<p class="speakable">Legendary basketball player Dennis Rodman was a star on the court for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/detroit-pistons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detroit Pistons</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/chicago-bulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago Bulls</a> during his playing days in the 90s, however, the five-time NBA champion isn’t much of a fan of the league that helped him gain his fame.</p>
<p class="speakable"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</u></strong></a></p>
<p>During Rodman’s era, the NBA was known for its toughness. During a recent interview on the &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDU9AQkMvmE&amp;t=1182s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Full Send</u></a>&#8221; podcast, Rodman says the league is hard to watch because of how much it has changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know, it’s just very hard to watch because once you’ve played the game the way we played it intensity, just competitiveness,&#8221; Rodman said via <a href="https://clutchpoints.com/warriors-news-dennis-rodman-takes-shot-at-stephen-curry-damian-lillard-for-why-he-doesnt-watch-the-nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Clutch Points</u></a>. &#8220;But now it’s more like you know I don’t want to watch players coming down shooting 50 footers, you know. That’s not basketball.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/golden-state-warriors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golden State Warriors</a> guard <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/stephen-curry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steph Curry</a> and other three-point shooters have transformed a league that was built on physicality in the paint into a new era where teams now live-and-die by 3-pointers. Rodman, who was a key figure in Michael Jordan’s documentary &#8220;The Last Dance&#8221;, added that the NBA is &#8220;difficult to watch, but a lot of kids love it.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</u></strong></a></p>
<p>During Rodman’s final season with the Bulls in 1997-98, Chicago attempted 11.7 three-pointers per game. To put that into context, Curry attempted 12.7 threes per game while hitting 42.1 percent of his shots from beyond-the-arc.</p>

<p class="speakable"><a href="https://deadline.com/tag/stanley-tucci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanley Tucci</a>, whose acting credits include &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; and &#8220;Supernova,&#8221; has spoken out about his <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a> diagnosis and treatments in a new interview.</p>
<p class="speakable">In an interview with <a href="https://flywith.virginatlantic.com/content/dam/HelpCentre/ife/refresh/magazine/vera-september-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vera magazine</a>, Tucci said he was diagnosed three years ago with a tumor at the base of his tongue. The mass &#8220;was too big to operate&#8221; and could only be treated with &#8220;high-dose radiation and chemo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having been through a cancer ordeal when his first wife, Kate Spath-Tucci, had breast cancer more than a decade ago, Tucci was wary of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’d vowed I’d never do anything like that, because my first wife died of cancer, and to watch her go through those treatments for years was horrible,&#8221; Tucci said. Spath-Tucci died in 2009 at age 47.</p>

<p>Tucci shared that his treatment at one point involved the use of a feeding tube.</p>
<p>&#8220;The kids were great, but it was hard for them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had a feeding tube for six months. I could barely make it to the twins’ high school graduation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tucci said that his cancer treatment was successful. He said he now feels older from the experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Cancer] makes you more afraid and less afraid at the same time. I feel much older than I did before I was sick. But you still want to get ahead and get things done.&#8221;</p>

<p class="speakable">Two shots of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine </a>provide two times more protection against prolonged symptoms of coronavirus — <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/20/these-covid-long-haulers-suffer-side-effects-a-year-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so-called &#8220;long-haul&#8221;</a> (or just &#8220;long&#8221;) COVID — according to a new study.</p>
<p class="speakable">Researchers at King’s College London found that a double dose of the antidote in adults can halve the odds of developing long COVID, if they should become infected. Severity of symptoms was also reduced by nearly a third, at 31%.</p>
<p>People aged 60 and over saw perhaps the more crucial benefits, as those who had two shots were more likely to report no symptoms at all compared to unvaccinated seniors.</p>
<p>Published on Wednesday <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00460-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the Lancet</a>, researchers analyzed health data from more than 2 million patients between December 2020 and July 2021, as part of the UK Zoe COVID Symptom Study initiative, which allows participants to report on their condition via smartphone app.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-19-cases-increasing-children-data-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>COVID-19 CASES INCREASING AMONG US CHILDREN, DATA SHOWS</strong></a></p>
<p>Research lead Dr. Claire Steves, of King’s College, suggested that &#8220;double vaccination significantly reduces the risk of both catching the virus and, if you do, developing long-standing symptoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steves <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/927103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added in a statement</a>, &#8220;Among our frail, older adults and those living in deprived areas the risk is still significant and they should be urgently prioritized for second and booster vaccinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Results showed that approximately 6,030 app users reported testing positive for coronavirus at least 14 days after their first dose, and 2,370 became sick at seven days or more after their second.</p>
<p>Vaccinated study participants were also half as likely to develop multiple symptoms associated with the virus, such as cough, fever, headache, fatigue and loss of smell, to name a few, and those who did reported milder effects than unvaccinated patients.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-long-haulers-face-fatigue-neurologic-symptoms-months-later-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CORONAVIRUS LONG HAULERS OFTEN FACE FATIGUE, NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS MONTHS LATER: STUDY</strong></a></p>
<p>Notably, they found sneezing was the only symptom more common in infected people with one dose of the vaccine, compared to those with none.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaccinations are massively reducing the chances of people getting long Covid in two ways,&#8221; said King’s College professor Tim Spector, one of the study’s authors. &#8220;Firstly, by reducing the risk of any symptoms by eight- to 10-fold, and then by halving the chances of any infection turning into long Covid, if it does happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the duration of symptoms, we are seeing that infections after two vaccinations are also much milder, so vaccines are really changing the disease and for the better. We are encouraging people to get their second jab as soon as they can,&#8221; Spector added.</p>
<p>Their study did not include data from children, who are not yet approved for the vaccine in the UK nor here in the US — though they are <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/covid-19-vaccines-for-kids-under-12-expected-by-mid-winter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to become available</a> to those 12 and under by mid-winter. Cases surged five-fold within the demographic during the past month, climbing from 38,000 the week ending July 22 to nearly 204,000 as of Aug. 26, <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the American Academy of Pediatrics</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said they are monitoring potential cases of long-haul COVID in kids, even among those who experienced only mild symptoms <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/04/covid-19-cases-in-children-surge-84-percent-in-one-week-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during infection</a>. &#8220;We are seeing long COVID symptoms [in children], mostly fatigue and headache,&#8221; said CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/12/cdc-investigating-possible-long-haul-covid-19-in-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>As of one week ago, <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 4.8 million children</a> in the US have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began, out of a total case load of 39.5 million — and counting.</p>

<p class="speakable">It’s the kiss of death for Latin American communities in the U.S.</p>
<p class="speakable">While health experts often warn of mosquitoes and other disease-carrying bugs, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deadly kissing bug</a> — a k a the triatomine bug, which kills 10,000 people per year globally — continues to be overlooked in the U.S., as it disproportionately affects poor Hispanic communities. That alarming disparity is the subject of the new book &#8220;The Kissing Bug: A True Story of a Family, an Insect, and a Nation’s Neglect of a Deadly Disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, not even the infectious disease world is immune to racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The disease] was still very much being neglected by medical schools, medical institutions and public health officials, that was such a shock,&#8221; author Daisy Hernández told NBC of the shocking find.</p>
<p>The Colombian American’s first experience with the scourge came when her aunt died from complications of Chagas disease, a parasite spread by the kissing bug. (Its colloquial name is due to its habit of biting sleeping victims on their faces, according to USA Today.) Most fatalities are caused by the Chagas parasite ravaging the patient’s heart and digestive system.</p>
<p>In light of the horrific event, Hernández has made it her mission to cover every facet of the disease.</p>

<p>First discovered in 1909 by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas</a>, the ailment has a fraught history in the U.S. &#8220;Kissing Bug&#8221; details a beastly experiment in the 1940s, in which a Texas researcher purposefully planted kissing bugs on a young Black psychiatric patient in order to study Chagas’ effects.</p>
<p>Today, the underreported affliction affects 300,000 people in the U.S., predominantly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latin American immigrants</a> in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida,</a> NBC reported. Unfortunately, as there is no national surveillance program, it’s unclear where people are most affected by Chagas in this country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chagas disease is a disease of inequity,&#8221; lamented Dr. Norman Beatty, a University of Florida medicine professor who has been studying Chagas since 2015.</p>
<p>The parasitic condition is also not a high priority in the medical community, according to Dr. S. Wesley Long, medical director of microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital. He explained that physicians are taught that &#8220;When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses, not zebras,&#8221; he told USA Today. &#8220;Chagas is a zebra.&#8221; </p>
<p>That apparent lack of attention — and data — is particularly problematic given the insidious nature of the disease, which can spread from person to person via everything from organ donations to blood transfusions, the CDC reported. Mothers can even infect their babies with Chagas during pregnancy.</p>
<p>In addition, many victims aren’t even aware they’ve contracted Chagas, as they don’t exhibit any symptoms. Or if they do, they often entail &#8220;fever, fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes&#8221; and other &#8220;flu-like&#8221; symptoms that will dissipate quickly, providing no indication that the parasite is still coursing through their system, according to Beatty.</p>
<p>When it finally manifests, the effects are usually cataclysmic, with 20% to 30% of patients experiencing cardiac and gastrointestinal complications — as was the case with Hernández’s aunt.</p>
<p>Anti-parasitic drugs can help prevent the spread but only if the infection is detected early.</p>

<p>That can be a tall order given the lack of health care access in many Latin American immigrant enclaves — not to mention that Latinos have the highest rates of uninsured people among any racial or ethnic group, which can prove disastrous for low-income Chagas sufferers, NBC reported.</p>
<p>Hernández cites the case of 40-year-old Carlos, whose Chagas-induced heart condition kept him from holding down a job. However, in a vicious catch-22, he was forced to keep working to pay his outstanding medical bills.</p>
<p>It’s not only about &#8220;getting access to health care,&#8221; explained Hernández. &#8220;It’s also being able to take time off from work to go to an appointment, to go to multiple appointments.&#8221;</p>

<p class="speakable"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">White House</a> chief of staff Ron Klain said Sunday there are &#8220;around&#8221; one hundred U.S. citizens left in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afghanistan</a> and that &#8220;many of them want to stay,&#8221; despite reports that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/taliban-special-forces-bring-abrupt-end-to-womens-protest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taliban</a> fighters have been carrying out violent reprisals on Americans and Afghan allies since the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. military</a> completed its withdrawal last week.</p>
<p class="speakable">Appearing on &#8220;State of the Union&#8221; with CNN’s Dana Bash, Klain said the U.S. government has been in close contact with the Americans still left in the country who have been located.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/taliban-hunting-americans-california-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TALIBAN IS &#8216;HUNTING AMERICANS,&#8217; SAYS CALIFORNIA MOM-TO-BE LEFT BEHIND IN AFGHANISTAN</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it’s around a hundred,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’re in touch with all of them, who we’ve identified, on a regular basis. Obviously, we’re hopeful that in the coming days that the Qataris will resume air service out of Kabul. And if they do, we’re obviously going to look to see if Americans can be on those flights. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to find ways to get them, the ones that want to leave, to get them out of Afghanistan,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We know many of them have family members, many of them want to stay, but the ones that want to leave, we’re going to get them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bash pressed Klain on reports from the ground in Afghanistan that paint a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/taliban-hunting-americans-california-afghanistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dire picture for Americans</a> or any Afghans who helped the U.S. military effort. A <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58395954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC report</a> last week citing sources in Afghanistan said the Taliban was carrying out mass killings of former Afghan officials and soldiers, despite repeatedly promising widespread amnesty while U.S. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military" target="_blank" rel="noopener">troops</a> still remained in Kabul. The last of those troops left Monday. </p>
<p><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The question is whether or not you’re hearing what we believe are credible reports about the Taliban systematically hunting them down, many of them, and killing them,&#8221; Bash said. &#8220;Have you heard about that and what is the administration doing about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are all kinds of reports coming in,&#8221; Klain hedged. &#8220;We’re in close communication with our sources and our contacts in Afghanistan to try to get those SIVs out safely. I know that some are coming out by land. We’re going to continue to work on efforts to get them out by air as well. We are going to continue to work to get those SIVs out of the country.&#8221;</p>
